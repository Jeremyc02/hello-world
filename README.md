# hello-world

Hi Everyone!!

My name is Jeremy and I new to the world of coding. I'm currently working to make my difficult transition from being a physical therapist assistant to a software developer. I didn't start with programming when I was in my teens like a lot of people but that's not going to stop me. I really love coding and I'm excited for my journey. I have a little experience with Python, Java and Javascript so far. I want to deepen my knowledge in Java and then I move to C++ once I feel good about Java. Please feel free to stop by and say hi or to give any advice!!
